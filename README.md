# virtual-keyboard

[RSS task week 7](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/stage1#week-7)

Functional requirements:
- design is at your discretion.
- index.html file should be empty (all the necessary elements are generated with the usage of JS)
- keystrokes are animated
- the virtual keyboard is able to switch between two language layouts (English + any other language)
- clicks on the buttons with a mouse on the virtual keyboard and pressing keys on a physical keyboard should input symbols to the text area located on the page above the virtual keyboard

In this task, I learned:

- generation of elements in DOM
- handling and catching events
- installing and configuring ESLint
- writing a Pull Request wish guideline
